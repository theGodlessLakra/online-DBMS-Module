# online-DBMS-Module
An Online Database Management System Module, to store the basic student details on a server, and few MySQL like commands to manipulate the data. This is just a small college project I was working on to demonstrate OOP. It includes TCP/IP socket programming, multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneous, serialization, and some other Java features. Please note that this is not to be used as a real world application.

# To Compile the Server
javac Server.java

# To Compile the Client
javac Client.java

# To Start the Server
Open up a terminal and type     "java Server [Port number]"

# To Connect the Client to the Server
Open another terminal and type  "java Client <localhost> [Port number]".
If the Server is run on a different machine, the client must substitute 'localhost' with the Server's IP address.
