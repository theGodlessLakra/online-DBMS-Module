# online-DBMS-Module
An Online Database Management System Module, to store the basic student details on a server, and few MySQL like commands to manipulate the data. This is just a personal project I was working on to test my C skills. It includes TCP/IP socket programming, multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneous, and some other C features. Please note that this is not to be used as a real world application.
